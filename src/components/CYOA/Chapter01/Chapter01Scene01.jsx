                Congratulations, you've been clever enough to solve the puzzle. I'm sure you thought it very simple, probably even obvious. But, have you considered easy puzzles are just meant to cast a wider net?

                Have you asked yourself why you decided to solve that puzzle? If a picture frame is titled sideways, do you feel the need to correct it? But, I bet there are still some dirty dishes in your sink.

                A pattern seeking mind can make for some strange behaviors. Rituals, traditions. All really just fabrications, at least to some extent. And yet, we choose to believe them. Are there greater clues within this world, just waiting to be put together? Is the entropy of existence contrived?

                When Apple originally implemented shuffle for iPods, people kept hearing patterns. And, despite Apple's continued explanations, many believed there was a conspiracy  at play. Finding similarities between the artists that played, for some grand scheme conducted between Apple and the record. They have the same record label! Those songs came out the same year! The lead singer's cousin was a roadie for three months for the other band! It's all coming together.

                The only solution Apple could contrive was to create a shuffle that <em>felt</em> more random, by creating a shuffling algorithm which actually mathemtically was <em>less</em> random. Pattern seeking minds, looking for something. Even when nothing is there.
